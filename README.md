This project employs the Coqui TTS open-source text-to-speech engine, specifically the multilingual, multi-speaker “XTTS-v2” model. XTTS-v2 is a transformer-based neural network designed for expressive, natural-sounding speech generation across many languages and voices. It reproduces human intonation and rhythm by processing text at the sentence level and synthesizing waveforms directly from the model’s internal acoustic representations. The implementation uses the Python Coqui-TTS library, running locally in CPU mode for portability and stability, with customized parameters to control pace and clarity—such as a sampling rate of 22.05 kHz, a pause duration of 0.25 seconds between segments, and a neutral male speaker profile known as “Craig Gutsy.” Audio segments are generated sequentially, merged into continuous narration, and paired with synchronized subtitles and a video overlay produced through FFmpeg. The entire process is fully open-source, requiring no external API calls, and emphasizes reproducibility, offline privacy, and fine control over both narration and presentation.

The Coqui TTS engine and its included models are distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0), a permissive open-source license that allows free use, modification, and redistribution of the software, provided that source-code changes remain publicly available under the same terms. This ensures that all derivative works remain part of the open research ecosystem while allowing commercial and non-commercial use alike.
